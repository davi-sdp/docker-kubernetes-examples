# Docker and Kubernetes examples
A collection of simple project examples using Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

Tô run each of them, install `Docker Desktop` and check `run.sh` or run it if you're on Linux.

Some of these examples have been copied from other repositories, and I’ve made a few modifications to them. Here are the credits:

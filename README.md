# Docker and Kubernetes examples
A collection of simple project examples using Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

To run each of the projects on each folder, install `Docker Desktop` and execute `run.sh` if you're on Linux.

Some of these examples have been copied from other repositories, and Iâ€™ve made a few modifications on them. Here are the credits:
- [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)
- [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app)

This demos has been presented in the DockerDay Campinas 2025.
